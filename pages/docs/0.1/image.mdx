# Images

## Types

TeXbld recognizes three distinct image types: from your local filesystem, from GitHub, and from Docker.
Local images must be located in `~/.config/texbld/packages`.

## Creating a custom image

1. cd into `~/.config/texbld/packages`.
2. Run `texbld generate image myimage`. This creates a new directory named `myimage` and populates it with an `image.toml`.
3. Edit the `image.toml`, which is pre-populated with all of the allowed
   configurations. 4. If you want to create another image configuration from the
   same set of files, create a new toml file (e.g. `anotherimage.toml`) and write
   it in the same format as the generated `image.toml`.

## Inherits

The `inherits` attribute in `image.toml` is used to describe what type of
TeXbld-recognized image your image should derive from. The chosen image will be
inherited using the `FROM` command in a Dockerfile. Furthermore, files copied to
the docker image (`[files]`), files to be copied to the project
(`[project.files]`), and project commands (`[project.commands]`) are all
inherited unless they are overrided by child packages.

## Uploading your image

1. Create a GitHub repository.
2. cd into the directory where your image resides.
3. Run `git init .` to initialize the git repository.
4. Run `git add . && git commit -m "first commit"` to make your first commit.
5. Add your GitHub repository as a remote and push.
