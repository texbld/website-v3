# Projects

Projects are generated via a parent image and contain the files and commands
that are described by them.

See <Link href="./image"> the image documentation </Link> to
see how images source their parent images for commands and files to be
scaffolded.

## Scaffolding a new Project

The `texbld generate` command scaffolds a project, copies over all files, and finally writes a `texbld.toml` file which describes its configuration.

### Docker image

Run `texbld generate docker (image name) (your image) (project directory)`

### Local image

Run `texbld generate local (relative path of your local image from ~/.config/texbld/packages) (project directory)`.
If you want to use a different configuration toml file other than `image.toml`,
use the `--config` option to indicate what file you want to use.

### GitHub image

Run `texbld generate github (owner) (repository) (project directory)`.
By default, it will pull the tarball from the `master` branch. However, when
populating the `texbld.toml`, it will use the GitHub API to check the commit SHA
and use that as the revision.

The `--rev` option allows you to specify a revision or a branch. The GitHub API
will be used so that only commit SHA's are used.

The `--sha256` option allows you to specify an exact sha256 of the tarball. This
can generally be computed for you, so you will likely not use this option very
often.

## Building the parent image

cd into the project directory and run `texbld build`, or `texbld build --cache`
if your TeXbld cache has **not been tampered with**. This builds the
docker image of the parent image.

## Compilation

TeXbld mounts the project directory onto the `/texbld`
directory in the container prior to any command execution.

In order to run commands, cd into your project directory and run `texbld run (name of the command)`. Commands are specified in the `[commands]` section of
your `texbld.toml` file.
