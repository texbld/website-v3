# Getting Started

Before you begin using TeXbld, you must install its dependencies and Docker.

## Installation

1. Install Docker. Platform-specific instructions are located in the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
2. Make sure that the Docker daemon is actually running, particularly with the desktop versions.
3. Install the latest possible version of Python 3 **and Pip**, either from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or from your local package manager.
4. Run `pip install -U texbld` from your command line, which pulls the latest version of TeXbld from the pypi registry.
5. Run `texbld` to verify that the program is installed and to create all of the necessary directories.

## Directories

The following directories will store all of TeXbld's configurations and cache:

1. `~/.config/texbld` - configuration directory
2. `~/.config/texbld/packages` - local images
3. `~/.cache/texbld` - cache directory
