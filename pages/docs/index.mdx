# Getting Started

## Dependencies

1. Make sure that your Python interpreter is at least version 3.9.
2. Install Docker. Platform-specific instructions are located in the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
3. Make sure that the Docker daemon is actually running, particularly with the desktop versions.

## Recommended: TeXbld-manager (Linux and MacOS)

<Link href='https://github.com/texbld/texbld-manager' isExternal>TeXbld-manager</Link> can install and manage different versions of TeXbld.

## Recommended for Nix Users

TeXbld is available as a nix flake. Run `nix profile install github:texbld/texbld` for the bleeding-edge version or `nix profile install github:texbld/texbld/release-0.3` for the latest stable release.

## Option 3: Stable Installation

**Note**: You may want to use a virtual environment to prevent texbld's dependencies from causing conflicts.

1. Make sure pip is on your system.
2. Run `pip install -U texbld` from your command line, which pulls the latest version of TeXbld from the pypi registry.
3. Run `texbld` to verify that the program is installed and to create all of the necessary directories.

## Option 4: Bleeding-Edge

The dependency-free zipapp (built nightly by the GitHub CI) is available <Link href="https://github.com/texbld/texbld/releases/download/nightly/texbld.pyz">here</Link>

# Additional Info

## Directories

The following directories will store all of TeXbld's configurations and cache:

1. `~/.config/texbld` - configuration directory
2. `~/.config/texbld/packages` - local images
3. `~/.cache/texbld` - cache directory
