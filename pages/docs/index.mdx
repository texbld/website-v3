# Getting Started

## Dependencies

1. Install Docker. Platform-specific instructions are located in the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
2. Make sure that the Docker daemon is actually running, particularly with the desktop versions.

## Option 1: Stable Installation

**Note**: You may want to use a virtual environment to prevent texbld's dependencies from causing conflicts.

1. Install the latest possible version of Python 3 **and Pip**, either from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or from your local package manager. **it must be at least 3.9.**
2. Run `pip install -U texbld` from your command line, which pulls the latest version of TeXbld from the pypi registry.
3. Run `texbld` to verify that the program is installed and to create all of the necessary directories.

## Option 2: Bleeding-Edge

The dependency-free zipapp (built nightly by the GitHub CI) is available <Link href="https://github.com/texbld/texbld/releases/download/nightly/texbld.pyz">here</Link>

## Option 3: Installation with Nix

TeXbld is available as a nix flake. Run `nix profile install github:texbld/texbld` for the bleeding-edge version or `nix profile install github:texbld/texbld/release-0.3` for the latest stable release.

## Option 4: Installer (WIP)

A custom installer/version manager is being developed <Link href="https://github.com/texbld/texbld-manager">here.</Link>


## Directories

The following directories will store all of TeXbld's configurations and cache:

1. `~/.config/texbld` - configuration directory
2. `~/.config/texbld/packages` - local images
3. `~/.cache/texbld` - cache directory
