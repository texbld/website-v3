# GitHub Revisions and SHA's

It is considered an anti-pattern to use a branch name as a revision because an exact
sha must be provided to preserve immutability.

Instead, use the TeXbld `getsha256` utility to get exact commit and tarball
hashes for GitHub repositories. Check out our guide on

to learn more.

A valid example: `texbld getsha256 github:texbld/templates#master`
