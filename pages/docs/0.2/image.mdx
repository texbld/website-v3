# Image Configuration

A TeXbld local image is stored as a directory in
`$HOME/.config/texbld/packages`. You can then upload it to GitHub to allow
others to access your image.

In order to make our first image, cd into the TeXbld packages directory and run
`texbld generate image myimage`. This will create an image with an image.toml
file with blank defaults.


# Allowed Keys

Although we go over configuration here, you might want to check out the
JSONschema <Link href="https://github.com/texbld/texbld/blob/master/texbld/parser/v1/image_schema.json" isExternal > here. </Link>

## Legend

`$IMAGE_DIR` will always be the root of your image, in our case,
`$HOME/.config/texbld/packages/myimage/`. `$PROJECT_DIR` will be the directory
into which a project is scaffolded.

## name (string) - REQUIRED

This specifies the name that will be used to prefix the docker image. Note: When
you scaffold a project based on a local image, TeXbld will use the **directory**
that the image is in and not this value.

## version (string) - REQUIRED

For this version of TeXbld, the only permitted version is "1". This option was
proactively made in order to allow new configurations in the future.

## inherit (table) - REQUIRED

The value of this specifies either a Docker image, a GitHub image, or a
LocalImage. When you inherit from an image, you inherit all files in the build
image and in the project scaffold (unless you overwrite them). The docker `FROM`
directive will be utilized in the generated Dockerfile.

Below are a set of mutually exclusive examples:

1. `github = {owner = "texbld", repository = "templates", revision = "(revision sha)", sha256 = "(tarball sha256)", config = "md.toml" }`
2. `local = {name = "template", config = "image.toml"}`
3. `docker = "alpine"`

You may notice that the GitHub and local image hashes have an extra (and
optional) "config" key. The default is always "image.toml", but this value
allows authors to share multiple different configurations stored in a single
repository. For example, an image might have a template for a vanilla assignment
in the `image.toml` file, while having a template for biology papers with
specific dependencies in the `bio.toml` file.

By default, the TeXbld cli will generate an image which inherits from the base
alpine image.

If you want to inherit from a GitHub image, refer 
<Link href="/docs/0.2/sha">here</Link> for pegging revisions and sha256's.

## install (string)

This is your package manager's install command. **It is only called if the
packages array is not empty.** Values for common linux docker images are as
follows:

- Alpine - `apk add`
- Debian - `apt install -y`
- Red Hat - `dnf install -y`

## packages (string array)

This is an array of packages to pass into the `install` command. For instance, a
TOML configuration file containing the following keys,

```
install = "apk add"
packages = [ "vim", "gzip" ]
```

would execute `apk add vim gzip`.

## update (string)

This command **is only run if you specify a non-empty string value for it**.
There may be instances in which you may absolutely need to update the package
index for your manager, but docker images usually make it so that you don't have
to. Most of the time, it will just bloat up your image build.

Needless to say, these are update commands for some common distros:

- Alpine - `apk update`
- Debian - `apt update -y`
- Red Hat - `dnf update -y`

## files (table)

These are custom scripts that are required on the docker image. In the following
example,

```
[files]
"directory/myscript.sh" = "/usr/bin/myscript"
"config.txt" = "/config"
```

The file in `$IMAGE_DIR/directory/myscript.sh` will get copied over to
`/usr/bin/myscript` in the final image, while `$IMAGE_DIR/config.txt` gets
copied over to `/config`. **Please use absolute paths**, or you might get
undesired behavior, as the working directory is the same as the one into which
texbld mounts a project (`/texbld`).

## setup (string array)

This array contains any extra commands that you might want to run **after**
copying your files over. You should not consider doing time-intensive steps
here. e.g. `setup = ['echo hello', 'echo world']`

## project.files (table)

This contains a set of key-value pairs indicating where you want files in your
image repository to go into a user's project. The keys indicate paths in your
image directory, while the values indicate the corresponding paths in a user's
project directory. The following example,

```
[project.files]
"directory/myscript.sh" = "ascript.sh"
"config.txt" = "src/config.txt"
```

would copy `$IMAGE_DIR/directory/myscript.sh` to `$PROJECT_DIR/ascript.sh`,
while `$IMAGE_DIR/config.txt` is copied to `src/config.txt`. Write these
key-value pairs so that they do not overwrite each other, unless you want
undesired behavior.

## project.commands (table)

This contains a set of key-value pairs for scripts that you want to be executed
project-side. They will be executed in a docker container, with the working
directory being the project root.

If an configuration was as follows and scaffolded,

```
[project.files]
"template.md" = "main.md"

[project.commands]
compile = "pandoc main.md -o main.pdf"
```

running `texbld run compile` with the working directory inside `$PROJECT_DIR`
would compile `$PROJECT_DIR/main.md` and create `$PROJECT_DIR/main.pdf`.

# Validation

After configuring our local image, we can validate it by running
`texbld validate image myimage`. If you also have a different configuration file
in `bio.toml`, you would run `texbld validate image myimage -c bio.toml`. A
`--cache` option is also present if you trust that your cache has not been
tampered with.
