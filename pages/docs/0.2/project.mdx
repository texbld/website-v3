# Projects

TeXbld projects are scaffolded and built from TeXbld images.

---

# Scaffolding

In order to scaffold a project into a currently non-existent directory
`$PROJECT_DIR` (replace this with the directory you want to scaffold into), run
`texbld generate project (image) $PROJECT_DIR`.

After scaffolding is complete, you will see that `$PROJECT_DIR` contains a
`texbld.toml` file and other files specified by image configurations.

## Image

While scaffolding, TeXbld will accept resource schemes. The following schemes
are supported:

1. For a GitHub image, use `github:(owner)/(repository)#(revision)` or
   `github:(owner)/(repository)` to get the latest revision on the default
   branch.
2. For a local image, use `local:(name)`.
3. For a docker image, use `docker:(name)`.

## Specifying another configuration file

Use the `--config (file)` option allows you to specify a different toml file
than the default `image.toml`. This is useful when a repository has multiple
different configurations

---

# Building an Image

Change your working directory to `$PROJECT_DIR` and run `texbld build`. This
will build out the corresponding docker image.

---

# Running Commands

Check the `commands` table of your `texbld.toml` file and execute the
appropriate alias.

For example, if your configuration has the following lines

```
[commands]
compile = "pandoc -o main.pdf main.md"
```

Running `texbld run compile` will run `pandoc -o main.pdf main.md` in a docker
container specified by your project's image. If you run
`texbld run nonexistent`, TeXbld will throw an error.

---

# Validation

Run `texbld validate project .`.
This checks that the texbld project located in your current working directory is valid. It is valid if no errors are thrown.

---

# Other Options

## name (string) - REQUIRED

This specifies the name of your project and is included for future use cases.

## version (string) - REQUIRED

For this version of TeXbld, the only permitted version is "1". This option was
proactively made in order to allow new configurations in the future.

## image (table) - REQUIRED

The value of this specifies either a Docker image, a GitHub image, or a
LocalImage.

Below are examples (mutually exclusive) of the above:

1. `github = {owner = "texbld", repository = "templates", revision = "7ababb02f2737b83e2ac632a03f27e7c891b163e", sha256 = "b173479d3166a3d7fa8941ff8bf40af100ba2d5cb5caf979b47c0934d417799f", config = "md.toml" }`
2. `local = {name = "mpl", config = "image.toml"}`
3. `docker = "alpine"`

You may notice that the GitHub and local image hashes have an extra (and
optional) "config" key. The default is always "image.toml", but this value
allows authors to share multiple different configurations stored in a single
repository. For example, an image might have a template for a vanilla assignment
in the `image.toml` file, while having a template for biology papers with
specific dependencies in the `bio.toml` file.

## commands (table) - REQUIRED

See above.
